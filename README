requested features:
		
	- browse through the comics,
	- see the comic details, including its description,
	- search for comics by the comic number as well as text,
	- get the comic explanation
	- favorite the comics, which would be available offline too,
	- send comics to others,
	- get notifications when a new comic is published,
	- support multiple form factors.

--------------

bare-minimum MVP should have: 

	- browse through comics
	- comic details
	- support multiple form factors

first thoughts:

	- most features could apply to any comic, not just xkcd. Can we make a generic app that just happens to consume xkcd?
	- should have simple UI (fullscreen pagination?)
	- xkcd API is simple json but 'search' and 'explanation' will require some investigation on how to consume 
	- MVP should be absolutely limited to above features and released as-is, any more features or improvements will go in the next version if time allows.
	- MVP can be made with vanilla swift. third-party libraries will come in handy for extra features
